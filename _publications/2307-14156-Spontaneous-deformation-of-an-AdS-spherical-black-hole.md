Abstract: In this study, we investigate the real-time dynamics during the spontaneous deformation of an unstable spherical black hole in asymptotically antiâ€“de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. For the initial value, the static solutions with spherical symmetry are obtained numerically, revealing the presence of a spinodal region in the phase diagram. From the linear stability analysis, we find that only the central part of such a thermodynamically unstable spinodal region leads to the emergence of a type of axial instability. To trigger the dynamical instability, an axial perturbation is imposed on the scalar field. As a result, by the fully nonlinear dynamical simulation, the spherical symmetry of the gravitational system is broken spontaneously, leading to the formation of an axisymmetric black hole.
