Abstract: In this work, we study the real-time dynamics of the charged hairy black hole with the time-dependent source of scalar field in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The numerical results reveal a novel descalarization mechanism. In order to obtain the hairy black hole as the initial data for the quench process, we first analyze the quasi-normal modes of the massive complex scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole background. We find the dominant unstable modes for large and small RN-AdS black holes come from the zero-damped modes and AdS modes, respectively. Then, the unstable RN-AdS black holes are perturbed to trigger the transition to hairy black holes. With the hairy black hole in hand, we specify a time dependent scalar source for the system. As the source is turned on, the electric charge, energy and scalar condensation of the system start to oscillate with the entropy increasing monotonically. Finally, with the decay of the scalar source, the system gradually settles down to a new state. Interestingly, the final state of the evolution could be a hairy black hole with less scalar condensation, a RN-AdS black hole or a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, which depends on the quench strength. However, as long as the quench strength is large enough, the system always loses all the electric charge and converges to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole.
