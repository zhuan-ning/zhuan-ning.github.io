My name is Zhuan Ning (宁专). I was born in Yiyang, Hunan Province, China. I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.itp.cas.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Rong-Gen Cai](https://itp.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrck/200907/t20090729_2282006.html). I am working on the field of Gravity and Cosmology. My research interests include numerical relativity, black hole dynamics, primordial black holes, and gravitational wave physics.
